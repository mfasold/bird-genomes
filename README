============

Non-coding annotations, analyses scripts and resulting manuscript for 48 bird genomes.

#0. annotation tools:



#1. analyses tools:

cd bird-genomes

#Merge all the different annotations, resolve the major overlaps:
# Overlap rules are:
#  1. specific methods (e.g. tRNAscan, miRBase, ...) are selected over Rfam predictions
#  2. High-scoring predictions are selected over low-scoring predictions

#paste all the filenames together (check they coincide if adding new annotations) and run compete_clans.pl:
ls data/rfam/*gff > /tmp/blah1 && 
ls data/trnascan/*gff > /tmp/blah2 && 
ls data/mirbase/*gff > /tmp/blah3 && 
paste /tmp/blah1 /tmp/blah2 /tmp/blah3 | perl -lane 'if(/mirbase\/(\S+).gff/){print "scripts/compete_clans.pl -g $F[0] -g $F[1] -g $F[2] -cl data/clan_info.txt -od data/overlaps/ > data/merged-annotations/$1.gff"}' | sh

#generate the count matrices (in data/R) and run the R-code that generates the figures: 
./scripts/gffs2heatmaps.pl
